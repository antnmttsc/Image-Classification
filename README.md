I utilized data from a Kaggle competition focused on image classification, which was proposed on Kaggle's platform (https://www.kaggle.com/c/image-classification-fashion-mnist/). 
The aim was to compare different classification models suitable for this task. 
Particularly, I implemented the following classifiers: Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

The performance results are loaded from the JSON file provided below, and a link to access the notebook containing the implementation is also provided.

In the notebook, simply run the "MODEL COMPARISON" section to see the results and a brief explanation.
